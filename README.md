Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things I should learn in the way of developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

This project contains a system which is able detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

The main files of this project is following:
1. P1.ipynb. 
This is a file containing project code
2. writeup_template.md
This is a file containing a brief write up explaining my solution. 

The requirements for this project are explained in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view)

The results of image processing are stored in the "out_images" directory.
The results of video processing are stored in the "test_videos_output" directory.
